## Introduce

1. All the memos comes from your daily notes, so you should open Daily Notes Plugin to make the plugin works.
2. And all memos are comes from a header you set( like `# Journal` ) in daily notes.
3. When you create a query, a query.md file will be generated automatically in your daily note folder.
4. When you delete a memo, it will send to the delete.md in your daily note folder, please don't edit it directly.

## How to Use

1. First you should have daily notes plugin (the core plugin of Obsidian) opened
2. Then, you should check the setting to set your header if you have some header in you daily note, OR leave blank to make the journal wrote to your the end of your daily note.
3. Open memos and then noteit.

Now memos find all the mark as follow in your daily notes.

Allow:

- `- 19:00` in daily note.
- `- [ ] 19:00` in daily note.
